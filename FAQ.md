### What is a PR?
A PR is a "Pull Request", a request to pull specific changes into the repository. This is how contributors suggest changes to the game in a way that allows those changes to be reviewed and potentially merged. GitHub documentation for Pull Requests is available here: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests

### How can I contribute?
You may contribute in a number of ways. Playtesting and reviewing PRs, creating your own PRs, testing and fixing bugs, streaming the game, and many more. See [Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional details on how to get started. 

### Do you accept donations?
We do not accept donations. We ask that you instead donate to a charity of your choice. Please see https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/Donations for more details.
