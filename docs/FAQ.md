### When will <thing> be completed?
Endless Sky is a community-driven project run entirely by volunteers. There is no specific timeline for when tasks will be worked on or finished; it depends entirely on our volunteers' schedules and availability. If you want to see something completed sooner, consider [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### What is a PR?
A PR is a "Pull Request", a request to pull specific changes into the repository. This is how contributors suggest changes to the game in a way that allows those changes to be reviewed and potentially merged. Check the official GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for additional details.

### How can I contribute?
You may contribute in many ways. Playtesting and reviewing PRs, creating your own PRs, testing and fixing bugs, streaming the game, and many more. See [Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional details on how to get started. 

### Can I add my own faction?
Certainly! However, be aware that adding a whole new faction is a significant task, which typically requires several years before it is merge-ready. If you're a new contributor, we usually recommend starting with a few smaller contributions, such as a short storyline or a couple of new missions, before attempting to create an entire faction. 

### Can I use LLM tools to contribute?
No. LLM-generated or assisted content is not permitted in the Endless Sky project. See our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Hecter94/endless-sky/blob/readme-refactor/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#on-ai-generatedassisted-content) for further details. 

### Do you accept donations?
We do not accept donations. We ask that you instead donate to a charity of your choice. Please see https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/Donations for more details. 

### What is a faction lead?
"Faction Lead" is an unofficial term used by the Endless Sky community to refer to someone who is especially knowledgeable about a specific faction. They may have created the faction or made significant contributions to it. It is not an official role and does not come with any additional rights or responsibilities. 

### What are author ships?
Author ships are special, unique ships that can spawn in the game. Each one is dedicated to a specific person or team of people who have made significant contributions to the project to recognize their efforts.

### What is tier?
Tiers are a balancing metric used to help our development team compare combat capabilities between ships of different factions. It is a very rough estimate of how combat-capable we expect a specific ship to be relative to other ships. Tier is not a measure of overall technological progress and should not be used as a strict guideline for what a faction can and cannot possess.
