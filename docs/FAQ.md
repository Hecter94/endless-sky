### What is a PR?
A PR is a "Pull Request", a request to pull specific changes into the repository. This is how contributors suggest changes to the game in a way that allows those changes to be reviewed and potentially merged. GitHub documentation for Pull Requests is available here: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests

### How can I contribute?
You may contribute in a number of ways. Playtesting and reviewing PRs, creating your own PRs, testing and fixing bugs, streaming the game, and many more. See [Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional details on how to get started. 

### Do you accept donations?
We do not accept donations. We ask that you instead donate to a charity of your choice. Please see https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/Donations for more details. 

### What is a faction lead?
"Faction Lead" is an unofficial term used by the Endless Sky community to refer to someone who is especially knowledgable about a specific faction. They may have created the faction or simply contributed a lot to it. 

### What are author ships?
Author ships are special unique ships that can spawn in the game. Each one is dedicated to a specific person or team of people who have contributed a lot to the project to recognize their efforts.

### What is tier?
Tiers are a balancing metric used to help our development team compare combat capabilities between ships of different factions. It is a very rough estimation of how combat-capable we expect a specific ship to be in relation to other ships. Tier is not a measure of overall technology progress and should not be used as a hard rule for what a faction can and cannot have.

### Can I contribute with LLM tools?
No. LLM generated or assisted content is not allowed in the Endless Sky project. See our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Hecter94/endless-sky/blob/readme-refactor/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#on-ai-generatedassisted-content) for more details.
