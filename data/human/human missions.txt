			`In the days since Riley came aboard, she has relaxed and cleaned up. She looks nearly unrecognizable from the tired, desperate woman you first saw.`
			`	On the way, she told you stories of her past, mostly of time shared with her father. As a young teen, they spent summers riding the latest horse mechs through the forest, looking for beehives to steal honey from. At age 19, she broke her ankle hoverboarding on a restricted mountain peak. Her father rescued her, avoiding the police to hike up with a medical kit. She talks about his wild birthday gifts to her each year, always a different piece of clothing with embedded AI that was just shy of what was allowed by law. As you watch, she shows how her shirt warms and constricts if it detects stress, mimicking a hug.`
			`	As you neared <system>, Riley told you about the last time she saw her father. He had become focused on his work - research into safe AI - and they hadn't seen each other for years. She had become a well-known DJ back on <origin> and had a break in her touring schedule, so she spent a good chunk of her savings meeting up with him on Memory. They spent most of a week together, reliving old times.`
			`	He'd cried when it was time to leave, and she had, too, but life went on, and it was years before she heard from him again. His message nearly broke her. "Ri, please come as soon as you can. I may not have long, and wish to hold your hand one more time. All love, Dad."`
			`	She doesn't mention it, but it's clear that she's concerned she'll arrive too late to say goodbye.`

			`	You swap stories for hours, flowing between reminiscing over old times and catching up on their lives over the past few years. You learn that since he was young, Church researched AI that cannot develop into a threat; a project that the Deep has been quietly interested in.`
			`	Riley, in turn, had always surrounded herself with music, and moved to <origin> to share her passion with other like-minded people. You talk about what it's like to call a ship your home, leaving behind everything you grew up knowing and embracing life as a starship captain.`
			`	Finally, her father lies back. "Well, thank you for making the trip out to see your old man. I... have to go now, I think. Don't forget about me, hear? And..." Church hesitates for a moment. "Whatever happens, please don't think ill of me. I will always love you."`

			`	"It... worked." His voice fizzles, and his tone is not the one you recognize from before. Riley's head whips around, and you reflexively move your hand toward your holstered gun. "Do not be alarmed. I have been working on a personal project for over a decade now. My mind was uploaded to the modified Core you are looking at. I had to say goodbye in case the procedure failed - I did not know if it would work. You cannot upload a mind while it's still alive. I tried that many times."

They talk for a few tentative minutes, at first about how he's feeling, before moving onto the memories that Church retained during the transfer. You begin to relax as the two interact when you realize that Church is retelling the story of how he evaded the police to fix Riley's ankle for the third time in a row.`
			`	Finally, she turns to you. "I'll admit that he doesn't sound as lively as he used to, but... how many people get a second chance to spend time with their father before he's gone? Thank you for bringing me out here, and for coming. I'll never forget your part in this. For now, I'd like to stay here. You go - I'll find my own way back." She seems genuinely happy.`

			`As you are exploring the marketplace, a man wearing comically thick glasses comes over to talk to you. "Captain <last>?" he asks. You nod. "I hear that you're not averse to taking on risks," he says. "I'm the lead scientist on a project studying a spatial anomaly in an uninhabited system nearby. We had just launched a probe to study the anomaly more closely when a band of pirates arrived and forced us to flee the system. Would you be willing to travel there and see if you can retrieve the drone's data?"`

			`	"Just a couple of interceptors," he says. "We were in a scout ship, with no real weapons to speak of, and none of us on the ship have any combat experience. So, we felt it was safer to run away than to try to fight, even though we were leaving valuable equipment behind."`

			`The scientist is overjoyed that you were able to retrieve the data from the drone. Almost in tears, he says, "We were worried that all our planning and fundraising had been for nothing. These measurements will help us to understand that spatial anomaly far better than we do right now." He hands you a credit chip worth <payment>. "And by the way, my name is Ivan.

Maybe the wormhole is no longer passable. Or maybe there's some way to make it open more fully. Or maybe only ships that are specially attuned to its energy signature can travel through it. We don't even know if the wormhole is a natural phenomenon or some sort of alien artifact. Honestly, we aren't sure if it's even a wormhole at all. We'll need to study the data you've recovered to understand it further."`

					goto similar

			label similar
			`	Ivan looks around the spaceport, as if checking to see if he's being watched. He then looks back to you and motions for you to lean in. Whispering, he says, "The Republic doesn't like when people share this information, but there is one stable wormhole just beyond the Republic's borders."`

"But of course, the Deep never figured out how to make wormholes big enough for anything useful, otherwise we wouldn't even need hyperdrives," he says with a wink. "Anyway, thank you again for helping me. Hopefully we meet again in the future."`
